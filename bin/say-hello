#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello!"

# This file will be installed as `~/bin/say-hello`.
# Additionally, it will be available globally as `say-hello`, because `~/bin` has been added to the PATH in `bashrc`.

# In `doot/config.toml`, `implicit_dot` is set to true, which means that it should have been `~/.bin/say-hello`.
# However, notice the line `implicit_dot_ignore = [ "bin" ]`, meaning that the `bin` directory does not get the `.` prefix.
